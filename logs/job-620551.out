  DEPRECATION: Building 'deepspeed' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'deepspeed'.

When visiting the pier, which is located next to a lake, river, or harbor, you should be cautious about the following:

1. Weather conditions: Sudden changes in weather, such as storms or strong winds, can make the pier unsafe to walk on.
2. Tides: If the pier is located in an area with tidal fluctuations, be aware of the tide schedule and avoid walking on the pier during low tide.
3. Water depth: The water depth under the pier may be shallow, which can make it difficult to walk on, especially if you are wearing heavy shoes.
4. Slippery surfaces: The surface of the pier may be slippery, especially when wet, which can increase the risk of slips and falls.
5. Wildlife: Depending on the location, there may be wildlife, such as birds or fish, that can be startled by noise or movement, which may cause them to fly away or attack.
6. Personal belongings: Be cautious of pickpockets or thieves who may take advantage of the crowded environment.
7. Safety regulations: Follow any safety regulations posted at the pier, such as not smoking or not feeding the wildlife.

To capture the essence of this location, which is a pier extending out into the water, I would choose to photograph during sunrise or sunset. The soft, warm light of these times of day would create a serene and peaceful atmosphere, highlighting the calmness of the water and the pier's connection to the surrounding landscape. Additionally, the low-light conditions during sunrise or sunset would emphasize the pier's silhouette, further enhancing the image's visual impact. The weather conditions during these times of day are typically clear, with minimal cloud cover, which would allow for unobstructed views of the surrounding mountains and the pier's reflection in the water.
