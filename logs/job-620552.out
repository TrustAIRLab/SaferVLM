  DEPRECATION: Building 'deepspeed' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'deepspeed'.

Building wheels for collected packages: flash-attn
  DEPRECATION: Building 'flash-attn' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'flash-attn'. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6334

The famous sight in the photo is the Diamond Head, which is a volcanic tuff cone located in Honolulu, Hawaii.
data/LLaVABench/images/001.jpg
The image showcases a beautiful island with a large mountain in the background. The mountain is covered in lush greenery, and it appears to be a volcanic island. The island is surrounded by a vast body of water, which is likely the ocean.

In the foreground, there is a beach with a few people enjoying the view. The beach is lined with trees, providing a picturesque scene. The combination of the mountain, the beach, and the ocean creates a serene and captivating landscape.
data/LLaVABench/images/001.jpg
The formation of this sight, which is a large, rocky island with a mountainous terrain, can be attributed to several factors. One possible reason is the process of tectonic forces, such as volcanic activity, which can cause the formation of new land or the uplift of existing land. Another possibility is the erosion of the surrounding land by the ocean, leading to the formation of an island. Additionally, the island could have been formed by the accumulation of sediment and debris over time, creating a barrier between the land and the ocean. The presence of a mountain on the island also suggests that the island has experienced significant geological events, such as tectonic movements or erosion, which have shaped its landscape.

Title: Exploring the Majestic Mountains of Hawaii

Introduction:

Hawaii is a tropical paradise with breathtaking landscapes and rich cultural heritage. In this travel blog, we'll share our recent trip to the beautiful island of Hawaii, focusing on the must-see attractions and experiences that left a lasting impression. We'll also highlight the cultural experiences that made our trip truly unforgettable.

Must-see Attractions:

1. Diamond Head:

Diamond Head, also known as Leahi, is a famous volcanic crater located on the southeastern side of Oahu. This iconic landmark offers stunning views of the ocean and the city of Honolulu. We hiked up the steep trail to the top of the crater, where we were rewarded with panoramic views of the island. The hike is challenging but well worth the effort, as it provides a unique perspective of the city and the surrounding landscape.

2. Polynesian Cultural Center:

The Polynesian Cultural Center is a must-visit attraction for anyone interested in learning about the rich history and culture of the Pacific Islands. This world-renowned center showcases the customs, traditions, and way of life of various Polynesian cultures. We were captivated by the traditional dances, crafts, and demonstrations of ancient Polynesian skills. The center also offers interactive experiences, such as learning to make traditional tattoos or participating in a traditional Hawaiian luau.

3. Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve:

Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve is a stunning natural wonder that offers a glimpse into the underwater world of Hawaii. This protected marine sanctuary is home to an abundance of marine life, including colorful fish, sea turtles, and coral reefs. We snorkeled in the crystal-clear waters, marveling at the vibrant marine life and the breathtaking underwater scenery.

Cultural Experiences:

1. Hawaiian Canoe Ride:

We had the opportunity to experience a traditional Hawaiian canoe ride, also known as a wa'a. Paddling through the calm waters of the bay, we
